## Watch out! There are snakes ahead.

mod-or-die stylized as M.o.D is a python based game meant to teach basic modding skills and introduce people to Python.
Python 3.7+ is required to run the game and a basic knowledge of programming is helpful but not required.


## An Unbeatable Game

Mod the game to win, or else game over man.

Why would you want to play a game you can't win?
Well maybe it is unfair to say you _can't_ win. You totally can, you'll
just need to put on your thinking cap, get coding, and **mod** to win.

Each level is designed as an unbeatable puzzle that will have you boosting
 your character to new heights, running like a cheetah, and perhaps even flying.
 The decision is up to you on how you play as long as you can mod it in.
 

## Happy Hacking!

Level 0 is the tutorial and requires no coding to beat. From there each level
 will use a different character skill and eventually require more and more focused programming.
  
  Level ideas are welcome and can be submitted as issues to GitHub.
  
  Get hacking and we hope you learn a lot on your Python adventure.
